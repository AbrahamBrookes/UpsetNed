# The DeterministicPlayerCharacter is a player controller script that is not physics-driven. Instead
# of using a RigidBody3D and applying forces, we are using a PlayerCharacter3D and driving movement
# using move_and_slide.

# since we are rotating the mesh separately we need a reference to it
@export var mesh: MeshInstance3D
# child scripts and the state machine require a reference to the anim tree
@export var animTree : AnimationTree
# the state machine is our custom rolled state manager
@export var stateMachine : StateMachine

# bundled player camera
@export var camera: Camera3D
@export var camera_target_offset: Vector3

# the mouselook component acts like a mixin
@export var mouselook: Mouselook
